        <h3>1.'Mona Lisa'</h3>
    <p><strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> 
        <br>Estimated date: 1503 to 1519
        <br>Where to see it: Louvre Museum (Paris)
        <br>It should come as no surprise that the most famous painting in the world is that mysterious woman with the enigmatic smile. But that's one of the few certainties about this work of art.
        <br>The sitter in the painting is thought to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Florence merchant Francesco del Giocondo, but experts aren't sure. It did represent an innovation in art -- the painting is the earliest known Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait, according to the Louvre, where it was first installed in 1804.</p>

        <h3>2. 'The Last Supper'</h3>
        <br><p> <strong>Artist:</strong> Leonardo da Vinci
           <br> Estimated date: 1495 to 1498
           <br> Where to see it: Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan, Italy)
            <br>Leonardo, the original "Renaissance Man," is the only artist to appear on this list twice.
            <br>Painted in an era when religious imagery was still a dominant artistic theme, "The Last Supper" depicts the last time Jesus broke bread with his disciples before his crucifixion.
            <br>The painting is actually a huge fresco -- 4.6 meters (15 feet) high and 8.8 meters (28.9 feet) wide, which makes for a memorable viewing.</p>

        <br><h3>
            3. 'The Starry Night'
        </h3>
        <strong>Artist:</strong> Vincent van Gogh
        Date: 1889
         <br>   Where to see it: Museum of Modern Art (New York City)
        <br>The comparatively abstract painting is the signature example of van Gogh's innovative and bold use of thick brushstrokes. The painting's striking blues and yellows and the dreamy, swirling atmosphere have intrigued art lovers for decades.
    </div> 
    <div id="4">
        <br><h3>4. 'The Scream'
        </h3>
        <br>Artist: Edvard Munch
        <br>Date: 1893
        <br>Where to see it: National Museum (Oslo, Norway -- opening in 2020) and Munch Museum (Oslo -- through May 2020)
        <br>First things first -- "The Scream" is not a single work of art. According to a British Museum's blog, there are two paintings, two pastels and then an unspecified number of prints. The paintings reside in the National Museum and the Munch Museum, and in 2012, one of the pastels sold for almost $120 million at auction.
       <br> Much like the case of "Mona Lisa," daring thefts (1994 and 2004) of the two painting versions of "The Scream" helped elevate the public's awareness of the artworks. (Both were eventually found).

    <div id="5">
        <br><h3>5. 'Guernica'</h3>
        <br>Artist: Pablo Picasso
        <br>Date: 1937
        <br>Where to see it: Museo Reina Sofía (Madrid)
        <br>This is the most recent painting on this list, and it depicts the German aerial bombing of the town of Guernica in the Basque region during the Spanish Civil War.
        <br>The painting has that distinctive Picasso style, and its unflinching examination of the horrors of war made it an essential part of 20th century culture and history.
    </div>
    <div id="6">
        <br> <h3>6. 'The Kiss'</h3>
        <br>Artist: Gustav Klimt
        <br>Estimated date: 1907 to 1908
        <br>Where to see it: Upper Belvedere museum (Vienna, Austria)
        <br>With No. 6, we move from a study in hate to a study in love with Gustav Klimt's beloved "The Kiss."
        <br>From Klimt's "Golden Period," Byzantine artistic influences can be seen in the highly decorative robes worn by the passionate, life-sized couple.
        <br>The Upper Belvedere says that with "The Kiss," Klimt makes a "general allegorical statement about love being at the heart of human existence." Given its magnetic appeal, it seems people agree.

    <div id="7">
        <br><h3>7. 'Girl With a Pearl Earring'</h3>
       <br> Artist: Johannes Vermeer
<br>Estimated date: 1665
<br>Where to see it: Mauritshuis (The Hague, Netherlands)
<br>This intriguing favorite often gets compared with the "Mona Lisa." Besides the stylistic differences, technically "Girl With a Pearl Earring" isn't even a portrait, but a "tronie" -- a Dutch word for a painting of an imaginary figure with exaggerated features.
<br>The oil on canvas masterpiece is brilliant in its simplicity. The girl -- wearing a blue and gold turban and an oversized pearl earring -- is the entire focus with only a dark backdrop behind her.
    </div> 
    <div id="8">
        <h3>8. 'The Birth of Venus'</h3>
        <br>Artist: Sandro Botticelli
<br>Estimated date: 1485
<br>Where to see it: Le Gallerie Degli Uffizi (Florence, Italy)
<br>The oldest painting in the top 10 and competing with "The Kiss" for most sensuous, "The Birth of Venus" was probably commissioned by a member of the wealthy and art-loving Medici family, which ruled Florence and nearby areas for centuries.
<br>Marrying a renewed interest in classic Greek culture with Early Renaissance style, Botticelli creates an unforgettable figure with the Goddess of Love emerging from a huge scallop shell.
    </div>
    <div id="9">
        <br><h3>
            9. 'Las Meninas'
        </h3>
        <br>Artist: Diego Velázquez
<br>Date: 1656
<br>Where to see it: Museo del Prado (Madrid)
<br>Madrid is the only city in this roundup where you'll find two of the most 10 famous paintings, the first being "Guernica" at No. 5 and "Las Maninas" here at No. 9.
<br>Housed at the popular (and vast) Prado, "Las Meninas" is not only Diego Velázquez`s most famous painting, it's also one of his largest. The complexity of the work has fascinated art critics and the public for centuries.
<br>The painting does double duty as a portrait. It serves as a group portrait of Spanish royalty, but it's also a self-portrait of Velázquez himself at work (on the left).
